# DataGenie Hackathon 2023

The goal is to create an efficient time series model selection algorithm

## ToDO checkpoints

- [X] Classification Algorithm
    - [X] (Data Generation) Pick/generate the necessary features and label the data required for classification
    - [X] Train Classification Model with (5 output labels) and pickle\store the model.
- [X] Generate predictions  
- [X] REST API
    - [X] setup a template and have a placeholder function 
    - [X] Setup a POST method to use the classification model 
- [X] Simple UI & Deployment
    - [X] setup a template and have a placeholder function 
    - [X] Use the API defined to Display it to the users

## Time series Models used(FTTB):

- Prophet
- ARIMA
- ETS
- XGBoost
- Grey kite

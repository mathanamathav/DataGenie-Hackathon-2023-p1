# DataGenie Hackathon 2023

The goal is to create an efficient time series model selection algorithm

## ToDO checkpoints

- [ ] Classification Algorithm
    - [ ] (Data Generation) Pick/generate the necessary features and label the data required for classification
    - [ ] Train Classification Model with (5 output labels) and pickle\store the model.
- [ ] Generate predictions  
- [ ] REST API
    - [ ] Setup a POST method to use the classification model 
- [ ] Simple UI & Deployment
    - [ ] Use the API defined to Display it to the users

## Time series Models used(FTTB):

- Prophet
- ARIMA
- ETS
- XGBoost
- Grey kite

## PLAN(not fully implemented)
